    <h3 px 35> Final Choice! </h3>
    <p> If I had to choose one of these companies to make my website on, I would pick www.godaddy.com.
      I would choose godaddy because of the benifits it provides for my needs. There is no charge to create my website
     besides the optional add-ons that are avalible if needed. I also like the free privacy protection that
     comes with to keep my website safe. The only reason I would consider www.sitebuilder.com, is because of the option
     to have AI help make my website. Although this would be handy, I want a company that is easy to use in order to help
     me get better at making websites, rather than them doing all the work for me. For these reasons, I would
     trust www.godaddy.com to help me make my first website.
