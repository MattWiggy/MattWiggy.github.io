    <h1>Review of State's Websites</h1>
    <ol>
      <h2>1. <a href="https://www.nebraska.gov">Nebraska</a> </h2>
      <p> I enjoy this website and state a lot. Nebraska is beautiful and their website matches that. Although they don't capture the prettiest parts of the state in the picture, the website makes up for it with information. There are SOOO many different links, and I feel like I can find all I need with little searching. The menu is very useful. It covers almost everything, ranging from attractions, to government information. They even have some of their proudest accomplishments as a state on the page, which is a great touch. Although just because of your big ego with the accomplishment stuff, youre too cocky to get a 10/10. This website is very very clean and well put together and I am very impressed. Overall 9/10 </p>

      <h2>4. <a href="https://delaware.gov">Delaware</a> </h2>
      <p> Delaware I am impressed. I enjoyed checking out this website. It is very clean, and by far, the menu bar on the side with the little circles is the best part. Delaware was scaring me a little bit at first with the 3 political "featured highlights" at the bottom, but I decided to give it a second chance and click on the news tab. That tab alone saved the ranking. There were some pretty entertaining hunting and fishing articles to read. One thing though, you called yourself "delawareans". You lost a point for that just because it made me cringe. You should not be that proud to call youself that terrible name. But I guess I can be nice because my grandfather is technecally a "delawarean"... youre lucky. Overall 7/10 </p>

      <h2>2. <a href="https://www.illinois.gov">Illinois</a> </h2>
      <p> Honestly, going into this, I was expecting about as boring as the state itself. But I admit, I was pleasantly surprised. Theres a beautiful picture to greet me, and I like that the menu bar travels with me as I scroll down the page. As a lazy person, I dont like scrolling all the way to the top to find a different menu tab. One thing though Illinois... I really dont want to talk to you that much. The virtual assistant is useless to me. I feel like if I use that thing i'll just be talking to a corn stalk or blade of grass. Maybe its necessary, but it shouldnt take up that much of the page. I will give the website one thing, theres a lot of information and fun things to click on. The large amount of information on this website greatly helps the rating. Overall 6/10</p>

      <h2>3. <a href="https://www.myflorida.com">Florida</a> </h2>
    <p> Disapointed... simply disapointed. The picture to greet me is very nice only because it hides the shitshow of things that actually happen in Florida. Besides that, the website is pretty lame and the picture is the best part. When I go onto this website I have no idea what I want to look for. Theres no news articles or cool looking links to click. There needs to be something for everyone. Maybe a link to a fishing tournament, or a place to stay on the beach, or a crackhead mall would be fun to click on and learn more about. With all the fun things there are to do in Florida, the website doesnt show it off. Overall 5/10 </p>

    <h2>1. <a href="https://alaska.gov">Alaska</a> </h2>
<p> The great state of Alaska, is definitely not the great state of making websites. This poorly designed website makes me mad that it represents Alaska. when I clicked onto this website I expect something beautiful for the background showing off the wonderful state. Maybe an ocean or even a mountain or two, but we get nothing. You would think they have a ton of pretty pictures to post, but I guess their website is so old they can't post high pixel photos. Now all i'm stuck with is a blocky boring website with annoying political stuff to click on. Overall, greatly disapointed. Alaska: update your website. I know a guy named Jeff that can help. Overall 3/10</p>
