    <h1>Good Websites</h1>
    <ol>

      <li><a href="https://www.adidas.com/us">Adidas</a> </li>
      <p>The adidas website is one that I regularly visit and have gotten to know very well. As soon as you get to the main page, they have their newest deals and even discount codes to use when checking out. This front page is awesome because it is constantly being updated as new items are being released, and when new deals come out. I really like this website because of the functionality and effectiveness every tab has. The main page is so awesome in providing every link necessary to get around and search for products. You can look at the top of the page and sort by gender and from there search more specifically, or you can scroll all the way to the bottom of the page and search by sport. Another one of my favorite aspects of this site is the colors. The black and white colors are specifically dedicated to the search menus and background. I also like this contrast of the white background, and the bright colors for the photos and products. This helps to grab your attention and better organize the page, separating one product from another. I tried to inspect the html for this website, but it was hard to follow. I can only assume that since there are so many pages and links, the coding is incredibly long. Another great aspect of this website is the speed and effectiveness. There is almost no wait time when you click on a new directory or scroll through the page. Another fun thing that makes the website appear to flow better is that when you scroll down and load more of the page, the items slowly fade into picture, they do not abruptly pop up. This little detail is something that makes the page appear to flow better. </p>

      <p>I really like the Liquid IV website because of the cleanliness and effectiveness. They do a good job at catching their customers as soon as they click on the website. As soon as the page opens you are greeted with their newest additions and flavors with a very professional picture and short attention grabbing description. There is not a menu at the top that can easily direct you to where you want to go, but all the information you need is on the main page. The website also runs very smooth and is never slow, even when shuffling through the products. I inspected the page to try and get a grasp of what the coding as looking like. They use html and the coding appeared to be pretty complicated. There were tons of lines with different classes, types and sources, so trying to navigate this as a beginner was very difficult. One thing that enjoy about the website is its simplicity. The colors of the website itself are very simple, but the colors of the product are very bright and uplifting. Another thing I enjoy about the website, is that they include all the nutrition facts on the front page. A product like this is aimed toward people interested in sports and athletics, so including nutritional facts is crucial to engaging their target audience.  </p>

<h1>Bad Website</h1>

<ol>

      <li><a href="https://www.craigslist.org/about/sites#US">Craigslist</a> </li>
      <p>When I read the assignment and saw I had to review one bad website, I knew exactly what to pick. Craigslist is well known for having a terrible website, and I agree with that. I think they went for a very simple approach to put a lot of information on one page, but it backfired. Right at the top of the page, they have a map that you can move around to find a certain region you want to look at. They had a great idea with this, but they had very poor execution. The map is slow, and very glitchy as you move it around. Not only this, but itâ€™s hard to even find the region you want to look for. I zoomed into the United States and tried to find Montana. Even as a Montana resident (and someone who is good at geography), I struggled to find Helena because the map was so poorly labeled and does fully load into view until you zoom all the way in. I then resorted to finding Montana in the long list of EVERY SINGLE REGION on the planet. Although it was alphabetically organized, I felt like I was searching forever. Their entire code is just unordered lists with links connected. As a beginner to html, I feel like I could make this website with ease. Not only is the website poorly designed and clustered, but it is incredibly boring. The only thing to look at on the main screen of this page, is a bad map, white background, with blue text.</p>
